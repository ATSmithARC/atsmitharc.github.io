They tend to inhabit sunny, brightly lit, open environments and are often attracted to open areas of flowers and clovers2. Adults spend time in small depressions in the ground on overcast days[2]. Vanessa cardui is extremely adaptable and thus can prosper in its niche in any of these environments[3]. Painted Ladies can be found at all elevations during migration but are usually found at elevations as low as sea level year-round, even during non-migratory time3. When the butterflies are found in large numbers, they can do serious damage to soybean crops[4].",

These medium-sized butterflies can cover a lot of ground, up to 100 miles per day during their migrations[3]. A painted lady is capable of reaching a speed of nearly 30 miles per hour[3]. Painted ladies reach northern areas well ahead of some of their more famous migrating cousins, like monarch butterflies[3].",
